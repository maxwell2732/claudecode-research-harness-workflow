# Memory Skills

A set of skills responsible for memory and SSOT management.

## Feature Details

| Feature | Details |

| **SSOT Initialization** | See [references/ssot-initialization.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/ssot-initialization.md) |
| **Plans.md Merge** | See [references/plans-merging.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/plans-merging.md) |
| **Migration** | See [references/workflow-migration.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/workflow-migration.md) |
| **Project Spec Sync** | See [references/sync-project-specs.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync-project-specs.md) |
| **Memory → SSOT Promotion** | See [references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md) |

## Unified Harness Memory (Shared DB)

For recording and searching shared across Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode, prefer `harness_mem_*` MCP.

- Search: `harness_mem_search`, `harness_mem_timeline`, `harness_mem_get_observations`
- Inject: `harness_mem_resume_pack`
- Record: `harness_mem_record_checkpoint`, `harness_mem_finalize_session`, `harness_mem_record_event`

## Relationship with Claude Code Auto-Memory (D22)

Harness SSOT memory (Layer 2) coexists with Claude Code auto-memory (Layer 1).
Auto-memory implicitly records general learnings, while SSOT explicitly manages project-specific decisions.
When Layer 1 insights are important for the whole project, promote them to Layer 2 with `/memory ssot`.

Details: [D22: 3-Layer Memory Architecture](../../.claude/memory/decisions.md#d22-3layer-memory-architecture)

## Execution Steps

1. Classify the user's request
2. Read the appropriate reference file from "Feature Details" above
3. Execute following its instructions

## SSOT Promotion

Persist important learnings from memory systems (Claude-mem / Serena) into SSOT.

- "**Save what we learned**" → [references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md)
- "**Promote decisions to SSOT**" → [references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/sync-ssot-from-memory.md)
